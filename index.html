<h1 align="center">The Church of Inquiry</h1>
<p>The Church of Inquiry believes that the universe has a Creator, that we exist for a purpose, and that there’s a path of accessible evidence that suggests the Creator is knowable to us through the methods and practice of science. We believe our purpose is to follow that path of evidence because we believe that it is within everyone’s power to achieve a direct, verifiable, repeatable experience with the Creator.</p>

<p>Humans have been endowed with minds that enable us to engage in a process of systematic and rational inquiry. We have the tools, methodologies, ability, and curiosity necessary to answer the big questions of existence. We do so by working actively to understand the mechanisms of nature, the functioning of our world, and the underlying cohesion of all things in creation. Using the methods and practice
of science, coupled with our capacities to imagine, question, and create, we believe we can achieve communion with the Creator.</p>
<p>Only in nature can one find the pure word of the Creator, so we look to nature and the natural sciences to find the guidance that will allow us to decode the language of the Creator. Just as a child must learn the language of its parents, we must learn the divine language, since it is only in that language — and not through the words of men — that we will find true guidance.</p>
<p>It is through this practice that we honor and find communion with the Creator. All should be united in this task since only our species has been given this gift. The Church of Inquiry offers a way to focus one’s attention and intention, and a methodology to bring the Divine into one’s daily life.</p>
<p>Honor the Creator. Honor the creation.</p>
